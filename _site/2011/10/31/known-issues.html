		<h3>Gettting Started</h3>

	Lets take that you have a controller and the constructor looks like this :


	public AccountController(IAccountService service)
	{
		this.service = service;
	}

*AccountService* is implemented in MyCoolWebSite.Services folder, in global.ascx you first need to add the following line:

	Container.Init();

However it is possible to specify assembly explictly. For example:

	Container.Init(Resolve.FromCurrentAssembly);

Similarly, you can do:

	Container.Init(Resolve.From(<YOUR_ASSEMBLY>));

Here to mention that AutoBox is a convention based tool, it means IAccountService will search for AccountService class that implements it.

Next you need to override the __GetControllerInstance__ from DefaultControllerFactory. Since AutoBox is implemented using __CommonServiceLocator__ you can directly include _ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance_ that will return the target controller with depencies properly injected.

	protected override IController GetControllerInstance(System.Web.Routing.RequestContext requestContext, Type controllerType)
	{
            return ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance(controllerType) as IController;
	}


And at the end of the Global.ascx.cs you need to write this line, so that the request goes through _AutoBox_:

	ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactory(new MyControllerFactory());


Now, moving forward there is a method in IProuductRepository lets say IProductReposiroty.GetAllProducts();

You just dont want to hit database all the time, unless invalidated. Therefore, you can further specify:

	Container.Setup<ProductRepository>(x=> x.GetAllProducts()).Caches(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10));

This tells AutoBox to cache the result of the call that will automatically invalidate after 10 minutes. However you can explictly specify the method that will invalidate it.

	Container.Setup<ProductRepository>(x=> x.Create(Arg.Varies<Product>()).Invalidates(x => x.GetAllProducts());

_Arg.Varies_ speicifies *Any* arguments. It can be also used for caching , this will act similar to _VaryByParams_.

However to cache an repository call, instead of Arg.Varies if you just want to pass default values and want to specify varible argument setup fluently, you can always do:

	Container.Setup<ProductRepository>(x=> x.GetPrdocutById(0)).Caches(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)).VaryByArgs();

Finally to make *Memcached* working you will need to have the following block in web.config (will be added automatically when installed from NUGet).


	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<configuration>

 		<configSections>
    			<section name="autoBox" type="AutoBox.AutoBoxSection, AutoBox" />
  		</configSections>

  		<autoBox cacheStore="localhost" cacheProvider="MemcachedProvider" />

	</configuration>


Here you will notice that by default its pointing to *localhost* and *MemcachedProvider*. However it can be an external IP pointing to __Amazon ElastiCache__(released a few weeks ago).Here to note that memcached is a caching machanism and therefore the tool is agnostic of underlying cloud service that you may use.

To test caching locally, you can use the  _CouchBase Membase server_ (Not limited to), it gives you a nice web based GUI to monitor the cache usage, configure memory and clusters.

You can download it from this link:

[http://www.couchbase.com/products-and-services/memcached/](http://www.couchbase.com/products-and-services/memcached/)


Once installed, you can double-click the "Membase Console" from desktop which will take you through an easy wizard to configure memcached.

Moving forward, there is a __AutoBox.Specification__ project. You can use *TestDriven.Net* to verify that all the tests pass and you have configured things correctly.

This is an early preview, therefore there might be glitches and feel free to file them and raise questions.





















	

		<h3>What is memcached ?</h3>

	Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.

you will find more information on this at : [http://www.memcached.org/](http://www.memcached.org/)





	

		<h3>Resources</h3>

	If dont want to use membase server (which is pretty easy) then you can also try the command-line tool from [jellycan](http://code.jellycan.com/memcached/).

There is a nice document on getting started with Amazon ElastiCache:

[Getting started with Amazon ElastiCache](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/GettingStartedGuide/)






	

		<h3>Known issues</h3>

	<p><strong>VerificationException -&gt; Operation could destablize the runtime</strong></p>

<p>This happens due to the conflict between NewtonSoft.dll and Intellitrace.Try to add NewtonSoft.dll to intellitrace ignore list.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Intellitrace -&gt; Modules</li>

<li>Add -&gt; NewtonSoft</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you can also turn off the intellitrace to avoid this.</p>


	

		<h3>Troubleshoot</h3>

	<p><em>Configuring Membase server</em></p>

<p>Since membase uses <em>IP_Addr.bat</em> from %Program_Files%\Membase\Server\bin that dynamically resolves the IP for your machine. In case that you are under a router and your IP is assigned dynamically each time, you can try the following:</p>

<p>Update the follwoing line in <em>service_register.bat</em>:</p>

<pre><code>Set IP_ADDR=127.0.0.1</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done, you can run <em>service_register.bat</em>(from command line or just double click it) that will initalize and register the membase server as a local service with your specified IP.</p>

<p>Moreover, you might find that membase server is not starting if you dont have VC++ redist installed. In that regard please check the following thread:</p>

<p>http://couchbase.org/forums/thread/membase-17-error-startup</p>
